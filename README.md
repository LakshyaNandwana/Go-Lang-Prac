### Introduction

This repository is a collection of Go programs ranging from beginner to advanced levels. It aims to provide clear, concise examples that can help you grasp key concepts in Go and apply them in real-world scenarios.

### Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have Go installed on your system.


Basic Go Programs
-----------------

The repository begins with basic Go programs to help you familiarize yourself with the syntax and fundamental concepts of the language. These programs covers:

*   Variables and Constants
*   Data Types
*   Control Structures (if-else, loops, switch)
*   Functions and Methods
*   Arrays and Slices
*   Maps
*   A little more! xD

Advanced Topics
---------------

### Interfaces

This section covers Go's interface type, which allows you to define the behavior that types must implement. You'll find examples demonstrating how to create and use interfaces in various scenarios.

### Goroutines

Goroutines are the foundation of concurrent programming in Go. This section explains how to create and manage goroutines, allowing you to execute functions concurrently.

### Channels

Channels are used to synchronize and communicate between goroutines. In this section, you'll learn how to create channels, send and receive data, and use them to coordinate between goroutines.

### Make

The `make` function is used to allocate and initialize slices, maps, and channels. This section provides examples of how to effectively use `make` in your programs.

Unit Testing Examples
---------------------

Testing is a crucial part of software development. This section includes simple examples of how to write and run unit tests in Go. You'll learn about Go's testing package and how to use it to ensure your code behaves as expected.

Web Application Examples
------------------------

Go is well-known for its performance and simplicity in building web applications. This section includes examples of how to set up a basic web server, handle routing, and work with templates. You'll also find examples of handling JSON, working with forms, and more.

Design Patterns in Go
---------------------

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. This section provides implementations of various design patterns in Go, including:

*   Singleton
*   Factory
*   Abstract Factory
*   Dependency Injection


Each pattern is explained with examples to demonstrate how it can be applied.
